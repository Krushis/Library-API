This is the project for the opportunity for a Full-Stack Developer Internship at Present Connection, using ASP.NET, React (with Tailwind) and an in-memory database.

A couple of disclaimers:

For now, when wanting to reserve the book if you click on a type that the book is not in, it just doesnt allow you
to make the reservation, so for instance, for the Hitchhiker's guide, you won't be able to reserve the audiobook version (it physically won't allow you to).

Also, you have to reload the web page for the reservations to show, and when you reserve something then a modal will popup
only then will it be confirmed that you have reserved sth, then reload the website.

I hope this website is not completely terrible :).

Thank you for this opportunity.
